#### StorIO — modern API for SQLiteDatabase and ContentResolver

Currently in development.

#####Overview:
* Powerful & Simple set of Operations: `Put`, `Get`, `Delete`
* API for Humans: Type Safety, Immutability & Thread-Safety
* Convenient builders with compile-time guarantees for required params. Forget about 6-7 `null` in queries
* Object mapping, if you don't want to work with `Cursor` and `ContentValues` you don't have to
* No reflection, `StorIO` is not ORM
* Every Operation over `StorIO` can be executed as blocking call or as `rx.Observable`
* `RxJava` as first class citizen, but it's not required dependency!
* `rx.Observable` from `Get` Operation can observe changes in `StorIO` and receive updates automatically
* `StorIO` is replacements for `SQLiteDatabase` and `ContentResolver` APIs
* `StorIO` + `RxJava` is replacement for `Loaders` API
* We are working on `MockStorIO` (similar to [MockWebServer](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver)) for easy unit testing

* [`StorIO ContentResolver`](docs/StorIOContentProvider.md)

Easy ways to learn how to use `StorIO` -> check out `Design Tests` and `Sample App`:

* [Design tests for StorIO SQLite](storio-sqlite/src/test/java/com/pushtorefresh/storio/sqlite/design)
* [Design tests for StorIO ContentResolver](storio-content-resolver/src/test/java/com/pushtorefresh/storio/contentresolver/design)
* [Sample App](storio-sample-app)

####Some examples

#####Get list of objects from SQLiteDatabase
```java
List<Tweet> tweets = storIOSQLite
  .get()
  .listOfObjects(Tweet.class) // Type safety
  .withQuery(new Query.Builder() // Query builder
    .table("tweets")
    .where("author = ?")
    .whereArgs("artem_zin") // Varargs Object..., no more new String[] {"I", "am", "tired", "of", "this", "shit"}
    .build()) // Query is immutable — you can save it and share without worries
  .prepare() // Operation builder
  .executeAsBlocking(); // Control flow is readable from top to bottom, just like with RxJava

```

#####Put something to SQLiteDatabase
```java
storIOSQLite
  .put() // Insert or Update
  .objects(Tweet.class, newTweets) // Type safety
  .prepare()
  .executeAsBlocking();
```

#####Delete something from SQLiteDatabase
```java
storIOSQLite
  .delete()
  .byQuery(new DeleteQuery.Builder()
    .table("tweets")
    .where("timestamp <= ?")
    .whereArgs(System.currentTimeMillis() - 86400)
    .build())
  .prepare()
  .executeAsBlocking();
```

####Reactive? Observable.just(true)!

#####Get something as rx.Observable
```java
storIOSQLite
  .get()
  .listOfObjects(Tweet.class)
  .withQuery(new Query.Builder()
    .table("tweets")
    .build())
  .prepare()
  .createObservable()
  .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io()) // Execute Get Operation on Background Thread
  .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread()) // Observe on Main Thread
  .subscribe(new Action1<List<Tweet>>() {
  	@Override public void call(List<Tweet> tweets) {
  	  adapter.setData(tweets); // display results
  	}
  });
```

#####Get something as rx.Observable and receive updates!
```java
storIOSQLite
  .get()
  .listOfObjects(Tweet.class)
  .withQuery(new Query.Builder()
    .table("tweets")
    .build())
  .prepare()
  .createObservableStream() // Get Result as rx.Observable and subscribe to further updates of tables from Query!
  .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
  .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
  .subscribe(new Action1<List<Tweet>>() { // don't forget to unsubscribe please
  	@Override public void call(List<Tweet> tweets) {
  	  // will be called with first result and then after each change of tables from Query
  	  // several changes in transaction -> one notification
  	  adapter.setData(tweets);
  	}
  });
```

#####Want to work with plain Cursor, no problems
```java
Cursor cursor = storIOSQLite
  .get()
  .cursor()
  .withQuery(new Query.Builder() // Or RawQuery
    .table("tweets")
    .where("who_cares = ?")
    .whereArgs("nobody")
    .build())
  .prepare()
  .executeAsBlocking();
```

####How object mapping works?
#####You can set default type mappings when you build instance of `StorIOSQLite` or `StorIOContentResolver`

```java
StorIOSQLite storIOSQLite = new DefaultStorIOSQLite.Builder()
  .db(someSQLiteDatabase)
  .addTypeDefaults(Tweet.class, new SQLiteTypeDefaults.Builder<Tweet>()
    .putResolver(Tweet.PUT_RESOLVER) // object that knows how to perform Put Operation (insert or update)
    .getResolver(Tweet.GET_RESOLVER) // object that knows how to perform Get Operation
    .deleteResolver(Tweet.DELETE_RESOLVER)  // object that knows how to perform Delete Operation
    .build())
  .addTypeDefaults(...)
  // other options
  .build(); // This instance of StorIOSQLite will know how to work with Tweet objects
```

You can override Operation Resolver per each individual Operation, it can be useful for working with `SQL JOIN`.
Also, as you can see, there is no Reflection, and no performance reduction in compare to manual object mapping code.

We are thinking about optional Compile-Time annotation processing for generating resolvers implementation in compile-time.

API of `StorIOContentResolver` is same.

####Architecture:
`StorIOSQLite` and `StorIOContentResolver` — are abstractions with default implementations: `DefaultStorIOSQLite` and `DefaultStorIOContentResolver`.

It means, that you can have your own implementation of `StorIOSQLite` and `StorIOContentResolver` with custom behavior, such as memory caching, verbose logging and so on or mock implementation for unit testing (we are working on `MockStorIO`).

One of the main goals of `StorIO` — clean API for Humans which will be easy to use and understand, that's why `StorIOSQLite` and `StorIOContentResolver` have just several methods, but we understand that sometimes you need to go under the hood and `StorIO` allows you to do it: `StorIOSQLite.Internal` and `StorIOContentResolver.Internal` encapsulates low-level methods, you can use them if you need, but please try to avoid it.

####Queries

All `Query` objects are immutable, you can share them safely.

####Concept of Prepared Operations
You may notice that each Operation (Get, Put, Delete) should be prepared with `prepare()`. `StorIO` has an entity called `PreparedOperation<T>`, and you can use them to perform group execution of several Prepared Operations or provide `PreparedOperation<T>` as a return type of your API (for example in Model layer) and client will decide how to execute it: `executeAsBlocking()` or `createObservable()` or `createObservableStream()` (if possible). Also, Prepared Operations might be useful for ORMs based on `StorIO`.

You can customize behavior of every Operation via `Resolvers`: `GetResolver`, `PutResolver`, `DeleteResolver`.
